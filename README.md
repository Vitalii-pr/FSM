# FSM Game

## Overview
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) representing a daily routine game. The game simulates a character's daily activities, such as sleeping, waking up, taking a shower, eating meals, studying, working out, and more. Users interact with the game by choosing actions at each state, influencing the character's well-being and productivity.

## Features
- Simulates a character's daily routine.
- Allows users to choose actions at each state to influence the character's well-being and productivity.
- Includes various states such as sleep, wake-up, meal time, chill, workout, take shower, reading, and study.
- Tracks character's indexes including freshness, productivity, appetite, and sleepiness.

## Getting Started
To start the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Vitalii-pr/FSM.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FSM
    ```
3. Run the main.py file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the game and make choices for the character's daily activities.

## Usage
- At each state, the game will display the current state and character's indexes including freshness, productivity, appetite, and sleepiness.
- Choose an action based on the available options presented.
- The game will update the character's indexes and transition to the next state accordingly.
- Continue making choices until the game ends or the character's routine completes.
